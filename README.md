# CrazySim: A Software-in-the-Loop Simulator for the Crazyflie Nano Quadrotor
This code accompanies the work in the ICRA 2024 paper "CrazySim: A Software-in-the-Loop Simulator for the Crazyflie Nano Quadrotor" [1]. CrazySim is a simulator platform that runs Crazyflie firmware in a simulation state on a desktop machine with integrated communication with Gazebo sensors and physics engine. The simulated Crazyflie firmware is intended to communicate with a custom Crazyflie Python library ([CFLib](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python)) provided in this code. This enables simulating the behavior of CFLib scripts that are intended to control single or multiple Crazyflies in a real hardware demonstration. With CFLib communication capabilities, users can choose to use [CrazySwarm2](https://github.com/IMRCLab/crazyswarm2) with CFLib as the backend for a ROS 2 interface with the simulator.

# CrazySim Setup

## Supported Platforms
This simulator is currently only supported on Ubuntu systems with at least 20.04. This is primarily a requirement from Gazebo Sim. The simulator was built, tested, and verified on 22.04 with Gazebo Garden.

To install this repository use the recursive command as shown below for HTTPS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gtfactslab/CrazySim.git --recursive
```

## crazyflie-lib-python
```bash
cd crazyflie-lib-python
pip install -e .
```

## crazyflie-clients-python [Optional]
[WARNING] This modified client package is only for software-in-the-loop and has several hardware specific features disabled. Do not use this package for your hardware.

If you want to test a single Crazyflie with a custom crazyflie-clients-python for SITL, then run the following command in your terminal. If pip reinstalls cflib, then you may have to remove it and install from source above.

Clone the custom crazyflie client.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/llanesc/crazyflie-clients-python
cd crazyflie-clients-python
```

Switch to the sitl-release branch and install.
```bash
git checkout sitl-release
pip install -e .
```

## crazyflie-firmware
[WARNING] This is a modified version of the crazyflie-firmware for software-in-the-loop. At this time do not use this firmware for your hardware. SITL integration with Kbuild is being developed for cross-platform building.

The installation instructions and usage are referenced in the [documentation](https://github.com/llanesc/crazyflie-firmware/blob/sitl/documentation.md) file.

### Dependencies
Run the following commands to install dependencies.
```bash
sudo apt install cmake build-essential
pip install Jinja2
```

#### Building the code
First install Gazebo Garden from https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install_ubuntu

Run the command to build the firmware and Gazebo plugins.
```bash
cd crazyflie-firmware
mkdir -p sitl_make/build && cd $_
cmake ..
make all
```

## How to use
Currently, users have to restart Gazebo after each CFLib connect and disconnect cycle. Supporting a restart cycle without restarting Gazebo is on the list of things to do.

### Start up SITL
Open a terminal and run
```bash
cd crazyflie-firmware
```

We can then run the firmware instance and spawn the models with Gazebo using a launch script. All launch scripts require a model argument `-m`. All currently implemented models are tabulated below.

| Models | Description |
| --- | --- |
| crazyflie | The default Crazyflie 2.1. |
| crazyflie_thrust_upgrade | The Crazyflie 2.1 with thrust upgrade bundle. |

#### Option 1: Spawning a single crazyflie model with initial position (x = 0, y = 0)
```bash
bash tools/crazyflie-simulation/simulator_files/gazebo/launch/sitl_singleagent.sh -m crazyflie -x 0 -y 0
```

#### Option 2: Spawning 8 crazyflie models to form a perfect square
```bash
bash tools/crazyflie-simulation/simulator_files/gazebo/launch/sitl_multiagent_square.sh -n 8 -m crazyflie
```

#### Option 3: Spawning multiple crazyflie models with positions defined in the *agents.txt* file. New vehicles are defined by adding a new line with comma deliminated initial position *x,y*.
```bash
bash tools/crazyflie-simulation/simulator_files/gazebo/launch/sitl_multiagent_text.sh -m crazyflie
```

Now you can run any CFLib Python script with URI `udp://0.0.0.0:19850`. For drone swarms increment the port for each additional drone.

You can also test a single crazyflie using the custom client if you installed it from the crazyflie-clients-python section.

First start up the custom client.
```bash
cfclient
```

Click on the SITL checkbox, scan, and connect. Once it's connected you can take off and fly using the command based flight controls.

### PID Tuning Example
One use case for simulating a crazyflie with the client is real time PID tuning. If you created a custom crazyflie with larger batteries, multiple decks, and upgraded motors, then it would be useful to tune the PIDs in a simulator platform before tuning live on hardware. An example of real time PID tuning is shown below.

# Crazyswarm2

This section follows the setup of CrazySwarm2 with CrazySim. We provide an example workflow of launching 4 Crazyflies using CrazySim and connect them to Crazyswarm2.

Make sure you have ROS 2 [Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html). 

Install the following for Crazyswarm2:
```bash
sudo apt install libboost-program-options-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
pip3 install rowan transforms3d
sudo apt install ros-humble-tf-transformations
```

### Configuration
The crazyswarm2  configuration files can be found in 
```bash
ros2_ws/src/crazyswarm2/crazyflie/config/
```
The crazyflies.yaml describes the robots currently being used. If a robot is not in the simulator or hardware, then it can be disabled by setting the enabled parameter to false. A more detailed description for crazyswarm2 configurations can be found [here](https://imrclab.github.io/crazyswarm2/usage.html).

### Start up the Firmware
Start up the firmware with any of the 3 launch script options. Below we demonstrate 4 Crazyflies in a square formation.
```bash
bash tools/crazyflie-simulation/simulator_files/gazebo/launch/sitl_multiagent_square.sh -n 4 -m crazyflie
```

### Start Crazyswarm2
Make sure that `cf_1`, `cf_2`, `cf_3`, and `cf_4` are enabled in the CrazySwarm2 configuration YAML file. Launch the Crazyswarm2 services with CFLib backend.
```bash
ros2 launch crazyflie launch.py backend:=cflib
```

## Versions
